    "\n",
    "### Movies, also known as films, are a type of visual comminication, which uses moving pictures and sounds to tell stories. The cinema, the entertainment industry has been a promininent factor by continuously influencing and defining our lives through producing movies that cater to us during different age groups. We remember growing up watching animated, Disney, movies, such as Lion King, during our childhood, to watching movies as teenagers, such as Harry Potter, to your 20's, such as Dark Knight. Despite your career path, friend circle, race, religion, age, one of the common themes everyone could come together and talk about is movies- it is hard to miss. While discussing ideas about what we would be interested in researching for this project, the topic of movies was brought up by Esmond. We immediately agreed on the topic because we started reminiscing about the 80's, 90's, 20's, and all the different movie eras. Enjoying our conversation and thinking about our fond memories of growing up around watching movies with friends and families, we knew movies was the topic we would want to focus on. "

    "## Stakeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growing up in an era of technology, it is impossible to ignore the technological advances made in every single industry, including entertainment. We went from an age where you could only watch movies in theaters, to renting movies from companies like blockbuster, to being able to watch movies avialable 24/7 with the help of companies like Netflix. Netflix, found in 1997 went from being the world's first online DVD rental system, to almost selling the entire business to Blockbuster, at the time, to, now, claiming 44% of the total online movie business. We would imagine a company, such as Netflix, being the stakeholder for our project. Our movie recommendation system would be of interest to Netflix, because it would be able to recommend movies to its user in a unique manner using our algorithm."

This data set fit the criteria our criteria of providing us with 100,000+ observations, and 6 variables. This data set was collected over a period of time, you can notice the movies that are rated in this data set range from the mid 1900's to early 2000's, providing us with a variety of movies for us to do analysis on."
